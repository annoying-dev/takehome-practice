# Take Home Practice for those 3-6 hour 
When all you do is edit YAML files and send memes at work but they want you to code 80% of the time. Do I look like a magician to you? This will be the most code I've written in like five years. LOL. k. bye.

## Revisit
- [Intuit](https://github.com/m4bui/CatMatch) - take home which was emulating image matching using txt files to represent cat images. Threshold on percentage matching. Follow-up: Scalability.
- [Netflix](https://github.com/mtabui/espeon) - design service discovery w/ health check was so fucking brutal.
- GlobalGiving (ANY) - front-end, consuming XML and displaying non-profits

## Attempt
- LTSE (Python) - SRE Take home (Incident Lifecycle Management, Post Mortem). 
- Chime (Python) - take home bug bash. Skipped doing it, should attempt it. 
- AngelList Ventures (Any) - Syndicate Allocation. Full Stack. Too math-y ðŸ˜­ 
- Comity (TBD) - It would make sense if it's some banking/lending backend service. Check Affirm's interview process glassdoor & 1.3 acres 
 
# Tech Stack
- backend: Java/Kotlin 
- database: LocalStack (DynamoDB, S3, SNS/SQS if relevant), Postgres, Redis.
- frontend: HTML/CSS JS. React/React Native if I finish training at work

# Must Have
- Basic file structure 
- Basic API w/ CRUD: Javalin/Jetty would be simplest to get started, but Vert.x would be better to learn
- Depedency injection 
- Unit Tests (Mock data)
- README.md : cover use cases, edge cases, design decisions, blah.

# Should have
- Decorators like @Autowire to auto-generate getters/setters
- Containerize (Dockerfile, docker-compose)

# Could Have
- CI (circle ci or github)
- System Design, what it would look like to scale. Lucid Chart in the company's brand

# Nice to Have
- Branding: Mascot/Service Name cause humor helps and so do pretty things.
- Contributing.md - Templates for PRs 
- Redis, LocalStack, Postgres, etc
- Test Coverage display
- Recorded Screenshare Demo: Vaam or Loom

# TODO Last Mile lol.
- Integration/E2E tests w/postman
- Performance testing w/ Jmeter or Gatling
- Swagger Docs or some Docs (OpenAPI decorator)
- React/React Native front-end
- Observability/Alerting system?
- Security Vulerabilities, versioning, rollback plans, traffic dialing, canary testing, incident handling blah
- Deploy to Heroku and point subdomain to it `<company>.annoying.dev` mostly for my own amusement


# Fintech. Random Notes. 
- Lithic, LC style -> paused
- Pilot -> ByteBoard -> paused but they're updating their technical screen
- Brex -> Moved straight to onsite but paused. Amazon vibes. Maybe Netflix vibes though.
- Column Tax -> 3 hr take-home, paused. conflict
- Pinwheel (TBD)
- Stilt (TBD) -> Same as Nova Credit in terms of product. Founders make the difference. Petal is same-ish? Sable is new to the game but seems to be doing well for pre-series A. Pay was concerning among other things (leaning on pause)
- SeriesFi -> Same as AL Ventures, racing for first-mover advantage. Live coding in Node/React (will likely pause, recruiter had a lot of candor)

# General Observations
Comity & Sable use the same bank to back their transactions. The founders at each company also came from BlueVine which was interesting. The market they are addressing is different though but eventually, there will be overlap. The pitch deck Sable uses is cut off even to investors which was curious. Comity also would not let me see pitch deck and mentioning column tax was a subtle trigger for the founder. It was slight but it was there. So many people are getting into this fintech space with an altruistic angle but the only way I can measure their ethics/execution is on past performance and history. Who were they during their childhood?

Most other places use Evolve & Trust, and I've seen mentions of Silicon Valley Bank, Bancorp, Green Dot. It would be nice to understand the difference.

# Questions
- How hard is it to build a tax refund service? I could talk to CPA and take select accounting classes again and try it in sandbox. 
- Can anyone be the middle-man to accessing government funding. It's basically just submitting a form on someone else's behalf? Research govt programs. 
- What does their growth marketing look like?
